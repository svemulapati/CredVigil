# CredVigil

**Continuous credential monitoring and detection for modern engineering teams.**

CredVigil is a layered, event-driven, zero-trust credential detection tool that scans codebases, files, and streams for leaked secrets. It combines regex pattern matching with Shannon entropy analysis, confidence scoring, and intelligent false-positive reduction — so your team only sees findings that matter.

---

## Why CredVigil?

Every year, millions of API keys, passwords, and tokens are accidentally committed to repositories or left in configuration files. Most secret detection tools give you a binary "found" or "not found" — flooding teams with alerts, including false positives, and offering no way to prioritize. CredVigil is different:

- **Confidence scoring (0–100%)** — every finding has a confidence score, so teams can set thresholds and eliminate alert fatigue
- **Zero-trust architecture** — raw secrets are never stored or transmitted; only SHA-256 hashes and redacted previews leave the scanner
- **False-positive intelligence** — detects placeholders, test fixtures, and documentation patterns and penalizes their scores
- **Dual detection** — regex patterns catch known formats; Shannon entropy catches novel secrets no rule covers
- **154 detection rules** covering the full modern stack (AI/ML, cloud, payment, databases, CI/CD, and more)
- **Continuous monitoring** (planned) — not just one-shot scans, but real-time watching across repos and infrastructure

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21+ installed

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/credvigil/credvigil.git
cd credvigil
go build ./cmd/credvigil
```

### Scan a file or directory

```bash
# Scan a single file
./credvigil scan path/to/file.env

# Scan an entire directory (recursive, auto-skips binaries/.git/node_modules)
./credvigil scan ./my-project/

# Scan from stdin
echo 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY' | ./credvigil scan --source stdin
```

### Filter and format

```bash
# Only show HIGH and CRITICAL severity findings
./credvigil scan --min-severity high ./src/

# JSON output (for CI/CD pipelines or other tools)
./credvigil scan --format json ./src/

# Set minimum confidence threshold
./credvigil scan --min-confidence 0.7 ./src/

# Disable entropy-based detection (regex only)
./credvigil scan --no-entropy ./src/
```

### List detection rules

```bash
./credvigil rules
```

## Architecture

CredVigil is built as a modular, component-based system. Each component is developed, tested, and validated independently before integration.

### Component Roadmap

| # | Component | Status | Description |
|---|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **Core Detection Engine** | ✅ Done | Regex + entropy scanning, confidence scoring, false-positive reduction |
| 2 | Secure Hashing & Metadata Pipeline | 🔜 Next | Zero-trust pipeline — hash, redact, enrich findings before storage |
| 3 | Git Integration Layer | ⬜ | Scan git history, blame, branches, PR diffs |
| 4 | File System Watcher | ⬜ | Real-time monitoring via fsnotify |
| 5 | Event Bus | ⬜ | Internal pub/sub for decoupled component communication |
| 6 | API Server | ⬜ | REST/gRPC API for integrations |
| 7 | Storage Layer | ⬜ | Persistent storage for findings, trends, audit trail |
| 8 | Web Dashboard | ⬜ | Visual overview of credential risk across repos |
| 9 | Notification Engine | ⬜ | Slack, email, webhook alerts on new findings |
| 10 | Policy Engine | ⬜ | Define and enforce credential security policies |
| 11 | CI/CD Integration | ⬜ | GitHub Actions, pre-commit hooks, pipeline gates |
| 12 | Compliance Reporter | ⬜ | SOC2, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS compliance reports |
| 13 | Secret Rotation Tracker | ⬜ | Track whether leaked secrets were actually rotated |
| 14 | ML Anomaly Detection | ⬜ | Catch novel secret patterns no regex would find |
| 15 | Plugin System | ⬜ | Extensible architecture for custom rules and integrations |

## Component 1: Core Detection Engine (Completed)

The foundation of CredVigil — a dual-strategy secret detection engine.

### How It Works

```
Input (file/stdin/stream)
    │
    ├── Regex Pattern Matching (154 rules)
    │     └── Known formats: ghp_*, AKIA*, sk_live_*, etc.
    │
    ├── Shannon Entropy Analysis
    │     └── Detects high-randomness strings that look like secrets
    │
    ├── Confidence Scoring (0.0 – 1.0)
    │     ├── Base confidence from rule
    │     ├── + Entropy boost (high entropy → more likely a real secret)
    │     ├── + Keyword proximity (nearby "password", "secret", "key")
    │     ├── − False positive penalty (placeholder, test data, docs)
    │     └── − Length/pattern penalties
    │
    └── Output: Findings with severity, confidence, SHA-256 hash, redacted preview
```

### Key Design Decisions

- **Zero-trust by default**: Raw secrets are never stored or transmitted. Every finding includes a SHA-256 hash for tracking and a redacted preview for display.
- **Confidence > binary**: Instead of "found" / "not found", every finding has a confidence score. This lets teams set thresholds and reduce alert fatigue.
- **Dual detection**: Regex catches known patterns; entropy catches novel/unknown secrets that no rule covers.
- **False-positive intelligence**: Detects placeholders (`EXAMPLE`, `TODO`, `changeme`, `your-key-here`), test fixtures, and documentation patterns — and penalizes their confidence scores.
